The application was built as a fork of TIC-80, extending its capabilities to create an integrated teacher platform where students could self-serve their learning journey. The C-based game engine communicated with a PHP Laravel backend that enabled students to develop games, run automated tests, and receive instant feedback - creating an interactive environment for learning game development fundamentals.
