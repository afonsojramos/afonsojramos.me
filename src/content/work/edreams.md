As a Backend Software Engineer at one of Europe's largest online travel companies, I developed and maintained critical backend services, including the most critical one, the search engine, using **Java** and **SQL**. I've helped architect event-driven systems with Apache Kafka for real-time data processing, while managing infrastructure deployments through Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
