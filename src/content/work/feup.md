As an Assistant Lecturer for the "Software Engineering" course, I provided comprehensive education on Agile project management to 2nd-year students, offering guidance during lab sessions and group assignments to help apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios. I assessed and graded projects and exams while providing constructive feedback, and promoted software development best practices and Agile methodologies to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges.
