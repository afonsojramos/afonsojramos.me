As a Software Engineer Summer Intern at Hostelworld Group, I researched implementations of Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) and Natural Language Understanding (**NLU**) javascript libraries to build a voice assistant for Hostelworld. I developed a voice assistant integration for Hostelworld's services, creating a more accessible way for users to interact with the platform. A brief overview of the project is available in my [afonsojramos/hostelworld-voice](https://github.com/afonsojramos/hostelworld-voice).
